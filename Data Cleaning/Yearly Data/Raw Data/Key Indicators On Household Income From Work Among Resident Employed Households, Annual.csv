"Data refer to resident employed households.  A resident employed household refers to a household where the household reference person is a resident (i.e. Singapore citizen or permanent resident), and with at least one employed person.  Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business.  However, it does not include the income of domestic workers.  Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.  Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of annual bonus.  Data on household income from work refers to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise.  The dollar values are in nominal terms.  More data and analyses on household income from work can be found in the paper 'Key Household Income Trends, 2022'.

Average Monthly Household Income From Work Per Household Member (Including Employer CPF Contributions) (Dollar):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Household income from work per household member refers to the household income from work divided by the total number of members in the household.  For example, if there is one person in a household of four who is employed, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household member.  The deciles are derived based on the ranking of resident employed households by their monthly household income from work per household member (including employer CPF contributions).  It is notable, for example, that some resident employed households in the lowest 10% owned a car (14.5%), employed a domestic worker (14.8%), lived in private property (7.1%) or were with household reference persons aged 65 years and over (32.2%) in 2022.  It is also important to recognise that not all households are consistently in the same decile group from one year to the next.  For example, an employed household may move down from a higher decile in a particular year due to the temporary unemployment of a household member, before moving up the deciles when the member resumes employment in the subsequent year.  In comparing the performance of any particular decile group over time, it is therefore relevant to note that the comparison may not pertain to the same group of households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gini Coefficient Based On Household Income From Work Per Household Member (Including Employer CPF Contributions) Before Accounting For Government Transfers And Taxes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same.  One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted.  Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable. There are different scales used by different countries and international organisations.

Gini Coefficient:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A summary measure of income inequality. It is equal to zero in the case of total income equality and equal to one in the case of total inequality. The more unequal the income distribution, the larger the value of the Gini coefficient. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Income from Work:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of domestic workers. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data on household income from work refer to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. As the income data pertain to income from work, the coverage of households is based on resident employed households. Data on household income are based on the sample of households surveyed in the June Comprehensive Labour Force Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Manpower every year, except for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020 which are based on the Censuses of Population and the mid-decade General Household Survey. The income estimates are based on income as reported by survey respondents and augmented with administrative data. Survey estimates are subject to sampling variability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Income from Work Per Household Member:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the household income from work divided by the total number of members in the household. For example, if there is one person in a household of four who is employed, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household   member. This takes into account the different sizes of households in each group and enables analysis of changes in household income, adjusted for changes in household size over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modified OECD Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The modified OECD scale assigns the first adult in the household a weight of 1 point, and each additional adult a weight of 0.5 points and each child a weight of 0.3 points. The equivalised household income is derived by dividing the total household income by the sum of the points allocated to the household members. For example, a household comprising 2 adults and 2 children would have a sum total of 2.1 points. If the household has income from work of $4,000, then the equivalised household income would be $1,905 (i.e. $4,000 divided by 2.1). The modified OECD scale is used by Eurostat and countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Square Root Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the square root scale, individuals are ranked by their household income on a ‘per equivalised member basis’, which is derived by dividing household income by the square root of household size. For example, based on the square root scale, a household of 4 having income from work of $4,000 would have an equivalised household income of $2,000 (i.e. $4,000 divided by the square root of 4). Individuals such as children and domestic workers would also be ranked. The square root scale is used by Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its major reports on inequality. It should be noted that some OECD countries publish their own Gini using a different equivalence scale, and not the square root scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
